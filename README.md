# OctoPrint-TranslateModel

Translate Model allows you to move models around in gcode files without reslicing.

## Features
* Select files via the translate button in the file pane
* Quick and easy model movement along the x and y axes
* Options to automatically print files after translation

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/Willmac16/OctoPrint-TranslateModel/archive/main.zip

* This plugin will compile its C++ code on install, but this should be pretty quick.
